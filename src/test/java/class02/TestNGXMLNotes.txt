==>TestNG XML
    *Gives us the control to decide what to execute from the whole project
        1. we can decide which package to execute
        2. we can decide which specific class to execute
        3. we can decide which methods to execute

        Task1:
        Class wise execution of Project suing testNg XML:
        <suite>
            <test >


                <classes>
                    <class name="class02.enableDisable"></class>
                    <class name="class01.testNGannotations"></class>
                    <class name="class02.priority"></class>
                </classes>
            </test>
        </suite>

    Task2:
    Method Wise execution
    <suite>
        <test >
        		<classes>
        			<class>
        		   		<methods>
                        		<include name="ThirdTest"></include>
                        		<include name="FourthTest"></include>
                        		<include name="FirstTest"></include>
                        		<include name="SecondTest"></include>
                    	</methods>
                    </class>
                  </classes>
        </test>
    </suite>

    Task3: package based Execution:
    <suite name="All Test Suite">
        <test>
          <packages>
              <package name="class01"></package>
          </packages>
        </test>
    </suite>

    Task4:
    Group based execution
    helps you run batch execution
    e.g you might want to run all the tst cases catogerized under smoke testing
    or you might want to run all test cases under the regression testing
    or you might want to run all the test cases belonging to login fucntionality
    Syntax:
    <suite>
        <test >
            <groups>
                <run>
                    <include name="regression"></include>
                </run>
            </groups>
            then u define class or package on which you want this to implement
            <packages>
                <package name="class02"></package>
            </packages>
        </test>
    </suite>
    Note:
    if you have a before or after method annotation associated with
    a particular @test annotaiton marked with some kind of group
    then you must must must mark you BEFORE AND AFTER method
    to (alwaysRun=ture)
