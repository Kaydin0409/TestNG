==>Assertions:
    *we are not using if else condition because even if the test case fails (i.e the conditon doesnt pass in if)
     the testNG will still show it has passed
     in order to overcome that we use Assertions from testNG:
     the library is Assert, and we call different types of assertions from it

    1)Hard Assertions
        *Assert.Assertequals(Expected value, Actual Value)  -->if they are equal, test case will pass
                                                            -->if not equal, test case will fail
        *Assert.assertTrue(boolean) --> if boolean is true, assertion will pass
                                    -->if false, test case will fail
        *Assert.assertFalse(boolean) -->opposite of assertTrue

    2)SoftAssertions
        *Soft assertions will execute all assertions that are there regardless of whether each one FAIL or PASS
        *Once it has evaluated all of them, then it will mark the test case as failed or passed
        -->it marks failed even if only 1 assertion has failed
        *The advantage of using soft assert is that we can see what errors we are having

        Soft asseertion will execute all assertions that are there despite of the fact that they FAIL or PASS
        and once it has evaluated them all then it will mark the test case as
        Failed or Passed
        (it marks it failed even if one assertion has failed)
        The advantage of using soft asssert is that we can
        see what errors we are having in other assertions that we make in the same test case
        but we cant see them if we use hardassertion as IT WILL EXIT AS SOON AS THE FIRST ASSERTION FAILS
        method to implement:
        1. delcare the instance
        softAssert soft =new softAssert();
        2.make assertions
        soft.assertEquals();
        3. at the end of makiing all assertions
        you must do
        soft.assertALL()
        this evalutes wether the test case has to be marked passed or failed
